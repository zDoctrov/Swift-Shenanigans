//Protocol: Enabling Communication Between Objects Not Related by Inheritance
//  Protocol = Declaration of a "programmatic interface" whose methods ANY CLASS
//  can implement. Protocols are a Objective-C language feature, simply speaking a list
//  of methods any class can implement
//EX: UITableviewDatasource protocol, whose methods cellforRowAtIndexPath
//  is declared in the protocol, but we implement it for creating the tableview

//Protocol = A set of methods that a class will implement:
//  "You dpm't care which class is used, as long as it implements this protocol"
