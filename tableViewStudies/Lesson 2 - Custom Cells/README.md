Notes from the lesson 2 video:

From a comment:
I've been hammering on this tutorial every day for more than a week and it's given a huge boost to my skills, 
thank you very much Sean! A hint from me for all potential newbies watching this: at 4:30 as Sean starts to edit 
Table View Cell size in storyboard, he still does it on the whole TABLE VIEW, rather than Table View Cell. 

That is important because both objects (the Table View and Table View Cell) have got "Row Height" attribute in 
their Size Inspectors. However, only by editing the former will we get a proper response. I'm sharing this because 
I wasn't enough attention at this point and I edited Table View Cell's Row Height instead, which gave me warnings like 
"Detected a case where constraints ambiguously suggest a height of zero for a table view cell's content view. We're 
considering the collapse unintentional and using standard height instead.", and the row height wouldn't change. 
That got me stuck for quite a while xD I think it will be useful to pin a notification at that point of the video 
to make that detail clear. That could save other absent-minded newbies like me hours or days of trying to find out what they've done wrong.
